<p>Leagues are basically private leaderboards for you and your friends to playfully compare your Summer Game stats with just each other.</p>
<p>Each player can create ONE league, but you can join more than one!</p>
<p>Making and joining leagues don't earn you more pointsâ€”they are just for fun!</p>
